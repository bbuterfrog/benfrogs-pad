<div id="self-form" class="content">
<p>Self-submitting forms have nearly always been possible with PHP, but back 
"in the day" (when we were all using static HTML, native JavaScript, and PHP 4), they were messy to
say the least.  Luckily, things have greatly evolved.  Many would say they have evolved past the point I
prefer to do them (many frameworks and the like have ways of putting them together), but I prefer to do new things
the "old-fashioned way" (hand-coding them myself).  It gives me more control, and a performance advantage.

That being said, there is no rational reason not to use JQuery and dynamic elements to make your forms and submit them, 
and give your users immediate feedback on the same page, particularly in the common case of a search form.  That's the example I'm using 
here because I've used it many times in production.  It's silly and annoying not to show search results on the same page as the form that 
produced them, and thus not to give users not only an idea of what they searched for, but the opportunity to "tweak" their results as they 
dig for items.
