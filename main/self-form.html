<div id="self-form" class="content">
<p>Self-submitting forms have nearly always been possible with PHP, but back 
"in the day" (when we were all using static HTML, native JavaScript, and PHP 4), they were messy to
say the least.  Luckily, things have greatly evolved.  Many would say they have evolved past the point I
prefer to do them (many frameworks and the like have ways of putting them together), but I prefer to do new things
by hand-coding them myself.  It gives me more control, and a performance advantage.

That being said, there is no rational reason not to use jQuery and dynamic elements to make your forms and submit them,
particularly in the common case of a search form.  That's the example I'm using 
here.  I've used it many times in production.  It's annoying not to show search results on the same page as the form that 
produced them, thus not giving users an idea of what they searched for.  Making this form resubmit in real-time also 
allows users to narrow or widen their search.
