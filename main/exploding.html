<div id="exploding" class="content">
<p>Boom!  Okay, now that we have that out of the way, not long after I first started using 
<a href="https://www.datatables.net">jQuery DataTables</a> I Googled for a way to "explode" rows.  
I finally found something like <a href="https://www.datatables.net/examples/api/row_details.html">this</a>
example, which has been expanded upon quite a bit since those days.  It now mentions the possiblity of exactly what I
decided to do, which was to not use static data in each row like it does, but to put a placeholder in each "exploded"
(expanded) row and then AJAX in the content (this keeps the DOM lightweight by not loading all of the "child" content, regardless
of how large it may be, for each row before the user actually requests it).  Let's explore a working example of that method, which I've
used many times in a production enviornment.
<br>
I'm using the <a href="https://github.com/datacharmer/test_db">Employees Sample Database</a> for this and other examples.  
This happens to appear to be the same example database they are using at least a part of in the above example, but I'm not going to repeat it.  
Instead, let's go a bit further by putting all 300,000+ employees in one place.  How the heck do we do that without using server-side DataTables
and forcing the poor user to search and scroll all day?  
Well, we have departments, and a table to join together employees and their department.  Let's see what happens when we do these
JOINs and a GROUP BY:
SELECT count(de.emp_no), d.dept_no, d.dept_name FROM departments d INNER JOIN dept_emp de ON d.dept_no = de.dept_no 
INNER JOIN employees e on de.emp_no = e.emp_no GROUP BY d.dept_no;
<br>
<table>
<thead><tr><td>count(de.emp_no)</td><td>dept_no</td><td>dept_name</td></tr></thead>
<tr><td>20211</td>	<td>d001</td>	<td>Marketing</td></tr>
<tr><td>17346</td>	<td>d002</td>	<td>Finance</td></tr>
<tr><td>17786</td>	<td>d003</td>	<td>Human Resources</td></tr>
<tr><td>73485</td>	<td>d004</td>	<td>Production</td></tr>
<tr><td>85707</td>	<td>d005</td>	<td>Development</td></tr>
<tr><td>20117</td>	<td>d006</td>	<td>Quality Management</td></tr>
<tr><td>52245</td>	<td>d007</td>	<td>Sales</td></tr>
<tr><td>21126</td>	<td>d008</td>	<td>Research</td></tr>
<tr><td>23580</td>	<td>d009</td>	<td>Customer Service</td></tr>
</table>
