<p>If you don't know who I am (and you care), I'm Ben Butler.  You can do anything you want with anything on this site, it's completely open-source and 
not under any kind of restrictive license.  I learned virtually everything I know about web development over the past 11 years online and everyone else
should be able to do the same.

As you might guess from that, I can't possibly credit or link to all of the resources I've used over the years, but some I've used directly to build this site
include:
