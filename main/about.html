<div id="about" class="content">
<p>If you don't know and care who I am, I'm Ben Butler.  You can do anything you want with anything on this site, it's completely open-source and 
not under any kind of restrictive license.  I learned virtually everything I know about web development over the past 11 years online and everyone else
should be able to do the same.
</p>

<p>
As you might guess from that, I can't possibly credit or link to all of the resources I've used over the years, but some I've used directly to build this site
include:
<a href="https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/layouts/rwd-fundamentals/">Responsive Web Design Fundamentals (Google Developers)</a><br>
<a href="http://demosthenes.info/blog/586/CSS-Fluid-Image-Techniques-for-Responsive-Site-Design">Fluid Image Techniques for Responsive Web Design (Dudley Storey)</a><br>

<p>If you're using a mobile device, you can't see how to reach or connect with me (you won't see a footer, because it would be annoying), so here that is:</p>
