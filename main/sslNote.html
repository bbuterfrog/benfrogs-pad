A quick update--note that I've gone to SSL on this site, as Chrome 50 and higher (now the stable version of Chrome) no longer supports Gelocation
without SSL.  This is generally a decent idea, and Chrome is the most popular browser on the web (I'm a Firefox user, but they appear to be moving that
direction too...).  If you have a personal site like I do, I highly recommend you look into <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/">Let's Encrypt</a>,
which for this site (Ubuntu under AWS running Apache), really was completely automated and is free for all platforms.  SSL is becoming a must for every
site for every purpose...
