<h3>Geocoding</h3>
<p>Let's start at the beginning, with your address/location data.  If you already have coordinates (latitude and longitude) for your addresses (as I did in my first
production project), you are in a reasonably decent place for now.  You'll basically be able to skip server-side geocoding, which is what it sounds like (getting coordinates for all of
the addresses in your database).  I decided to include this step in this example, using the <a href="https://dev.mysql.com/doc/sakila/en/">Sakila Sample Database</a>.  I'm 
actually using customer addresses for this example, so maybe we're making house calls?  Anyway, I used the 
<a href="https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/intro#Geocoding"> Google Maps Geocoding API</a> for this example, which I recommend, obviously 
for applications that are later going to make use of Google Maps.  There are other Geocoding API's out there, but I've generally found them to be less reliable and
less fast.  It's worth noting, though, that you are restricted with this server-side version to 2500 requests per day unless you or your organization is willing to start
paying, so you basically can just try it out for an example like this.  I wrote a <em>very</em> simple script using Sakila's schema to insert coordinates into a new table, it's
<a href="https://github.com/bbutlerfrog/benfrogs-pad/blob/master/main/php/geoCode.php">here</a>.  Note that while the call for Google's server-side geocoder is more-or-less
standard (it takes parameters with '+' signs instead of spaces as per the RFC for a URI, etc.) there are some quirks, such as the fact that if you have addresses all over 
the world (Salika does), the easiest way to override <a href="https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/intro#RegionCodes">Region Biasing</a> and find what
you want is to "Component Filtering", like this:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">
$geoCoderRequest = 'https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/geocode/json?address=' . $address . 
				   '&components=country:' .  str_replace(' ', '+', $row['country']) . '&key='
				   $this->geoKey;
</pre>
<p>In other words, you need to put the country in as a "component", not as part of the address.</p>
<p>Regardless of whether you have coordinates in your database or not, you'll likely want to use <em>dynamic</em> or <em>client-side</em> geocoding to help users find points 
in the part of the world they want on your map.
