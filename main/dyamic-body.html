<p class="lead">Crawlable "Dynamic" Content--How does that work?!</p>
<p>Ever since Google <a href="http://googlewebmastercentral.blogspot.com/2015/10/deprecating-our-ajax-crawling-scheme.html">
quietly announced</a> their intention to index dynamic content, their has been a great deal of conversation and controversy about whether
they actually meant what they said, and if it is even possible to begin with.  Whether they actually intend to start seeing pages
"like a modern browser," the fact is that making "dynamic" content appear in source code has been possible essentially since the introduction
of the DOM model, and certainly easier since the introduction of the jQuery wrapper for said model, largely through leveraging the
<a href="https://api.jquery.com/ready/">jQuery's document ready() function.</a>
I'll explore some of those methods in this article.</p>
<p>First off, let's start with this very page and site.  The body of this very article "started out" on the server as this:  
<pre class="prettyprint">
&lt;body&gt;
&lt;div id="header"&gt;
         &lt;/div&gt;
         &lt;div id="dymnamic-body"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
         &lt;footer class="footer"&gt;
      &lt;div class="container"&gt;
         &lt;div id="footer"&gt;
         &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/footer&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
</pre>
This was even after PHP was done pre-processsing it.  It was actually delivered to the client this way.  So what happened to get this
text, headers, and footer in place?  After all, if you view the source code of this page (go ahead, try it) you'll see that they are 
actually there.  They don't look like they were ajax'ed in.  Where's the magic?
