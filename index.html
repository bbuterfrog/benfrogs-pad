      <p class="lead">Hi!  Welcome to the pad!  Hope you enjoy your stay.  Feel free to hop around.</p>
      <p>I've written a couple of rants lately about 
      <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/dear-linkedin-what-responsive-design-means-ben-butler">
      LinkedIn's horrible new UI, and lack of understanding regarding responsive design</a> and 
      <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/i-just-wanted-watch-some-music-videos-why-qa-still-matters-ben-butler-2">
      QA, and why development teams should understand and do it</a>.  I'll link to them here, as if you asked me people are as likely to 
      visit this page as that hideous new pile of bad ideas LinkedIn has become (were they trying to prove it <em>could</em> get worse?!).</p>  
      <p>Anyway, I'd add more code here, but I've been pretty busy redeveloping the online payroll site I wrote in 2003 and putting in on 
      <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/">AWS</a>, since they have had decent <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/Overview.Encryption.html">
      RDS encryption for data at rest</a> since around 2015.  I obviously won't ever be able to open-source all of that code, but I'll probably be able to post at 
      least a short article about it here when I'm done.</p>
      <p> In the meantime, the most interesting thing here is still probably the <a href="main/maps.html">Google Maps walkthrough</a>.</p>
